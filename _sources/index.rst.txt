Skillect
========

Skillect project is meant to store my experiences in software engineering. It is a client-server website, built by Antoine Mandin.

- The webiste is deployed at `🌐 mandin.dev <https://mandin.dev>`_
- The source code is available at `🧑‍💻 GitHub: Doreapp/skillect <https://github.com/Doreapp/skillect>`_

It is also a way to offer an example of client-server website using
a `FastAPI <https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/>`_-based backend server with
a `React <https://reactjs.org/>`_-based frontend. As an open-sourced project,
curious developers can reuse the project as-is or fork-it to expose their own experiences
(even in fields not related to software engineering).
